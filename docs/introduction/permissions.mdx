# Permissions Model

AgentLogs gives you fine-grained control over which repositories are captured and how transcripts are shared.

## Capture Modes

AgentLogs supports two capture modes:

### Denylist Mode (Default)

By default, AgentLogs captures transcripts from **all repositories** except those you explicitly deny. This is the easiest way to get started.

```bash
# Deny a specific repo from being captured
agentlogs deny /path/to/private-repo
```

### Allowlist Mode

For stricter control, you can enable allowlist mode where **only explicitly allowed repositories** are captured.

```bash
# Enable allowlist mode
agentlogs settings --mode allowlist

# Allow a specific repo
agentlogs allow /path/to/my-repo
```

<Warning>When switching to allowlist mode, no repositories will be captured until you explicitly allow them.</Warning>

## Visibility Levels

Each transcript can have one of three visibility levels:

| Level       | Who can see               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| **Private** | Only you                  |
| **Team**    | You and your team members |
| **Public**  | Anyone with the link      |

### Default Visibility

By default, visibility is determined automatically:

- **Public repositories** → Team visibility
- **Private repositories** → Private visibility

### Override Visibility

You can override the default visibility when allowing a repo:

```bash
# Always make transcripts from this repo private
agentlogs allow /path/to/repo --visibility private

# Always make transcripts from this repo public
agentlogs allow /path/to/repo --visibility public
```

## Configuration File

Your permission settings are stored in `~/.config/agentlogs/settings.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  // "denylist" (default) or "allowlist"
  "mode": "denylist",

  // Repository-specific settings
  "repos": {
    "github.com/myorg/public-repo": {
      "allow": true,
      "visibility": "team",
    },
    "github.com/myorg/private-repo": {
      "allow": false,
    },
  },
}
```

<Tip>
  The settings file uses JSONC format, which supports comments. This makes it easy to annotate why certain repos have
  specific settings.
</Tip>

## Team Permissions

When you're part of a team:

- Team members can see transcripts with **team** or **public** visibility
- Only you can see your **private** transcripts
- Team admins can invite new members and manage team settings

To create or join a team, visit the [Team settings](https://agentlogs.ai/app/team) page.
