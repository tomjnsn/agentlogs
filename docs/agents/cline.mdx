# Cline Integration

Cline is an open source AI coding agent that brings frontier AI models directly to your workflow. AgentLogs provides automatic transcript capture through Cline's hooks system.

## Features

- **Automatic capture** - Transcripts are uploaded when a task completes or is cancelled
- **Commit tracking** - Git commits made during a task are linked to the transcript
- **Zero config** - A single CLI command installs the hooks

## Installation

### 1. Authentication

```bash
npx agentlogs login agentlogs.ai
```

### 2. Install hooks

```bash
npx agentlogs cline install
```

This creates hook scripts in `~/Documents/Cline/Hooks/` that automatically upload transcripts on task completion and cancellation.

Re-running `install` safely updates existing hooks managed by agentlogs. Hooks you created yourself are never overwritten.

## How It Works

Cline supports [file-based hooks](https://docs.cline.bot/features/hooks/hook-reference) — executable scripts that run at key points in a task's lifecycle. The install command creates three hooks:

- **`PostToolUse`** — after each tool execution, detects git commits and tracks the commit SHA against the transcript
- **`TaskComplete`** — runs when Cline finishes a task, uploads the transcript
- **`TaskCancel`** — runs when a task is cancelled, uploads what exists so far

Each hook pipes Cline's JSON payload to `agentlogs cline hook`, which routes by event type. Task uploads run in the background to avoid blocking Cline; commit tracking runs inline since it's fast.

## Manual Upload

You can also upload transcripts manually:

```bash
# Interactive picker to browse and upload any transcript
npx agentlogs upload

# Filter to only Cline transcripts
npx agentlogs upload --source cline

# Upload a specific task by Task ID
npx agentlogs cline upload <TASK-ID>

# Upload a specific transcript file
npx agentlogs cline upload ~/.cline/data/tasks/<TASK-ID>/api_conversation_history.json
```
