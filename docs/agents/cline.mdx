# Cline Integration

Cline is an open source AI coding agent that brings frontier AI models directly to your workflow. AgentLogs provides automatic transcript capture through an MCP server integration.

## Features

- **Automatic capture** - Transcripts are uploaded after each agent response
- **Background service** - Watches sessions and handles uploads automatically

## Installation

### 1. Authentication

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx agentlogs login agentlogs.ai
```

### 2. Configure MCP Server

<Accordion title="Manual configuration">
Add the following to your Cline MCP config file (`~/.cline/data/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`):

```json
{
  "agentlogs": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "agentlogs", "mcp"]
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

## How It Works

The MCP server is spawned by any Cline client and connects to a background service that watches `~/.cline/data/tasks/` for changes. When an agent response completes, the transcript is uploaded.

The MCP server doesn't expose any tools or prompts—it exists purely for lifecycle management. The background service shuts down automatically after all Cline sessions close.

## Manual Upload

You can manually upload transcripts using the CLI:

```bash
# Interactive picker to browse and upload any transcript
npx agentlogs upload

# Filter to only Cline transcripts
npx agentlogs upload --source cline

# Upload a specific task by Task ID
npx agentlogs cline upload <TASK-ID>

# Upload a specific transcript file
npx agentlogs cline upload ~/.cline/data/tasks/<TASK-ID>/api_conversation_history.json
```

The interactive `upload` command discovers transcripts from all agents and lets you pick one to upload.
