# OpenCode Integration

OpenCode is an open-source AI coding assistant. AgentLogs provides integration with OpenCode for automatic transcript sync.

## Features

- **Automatic sync** - Transcripts are uploaded automatically when the session becomes idle
- **Git commit enhancement** - Automatically adds transcript links to git commit messages

## Installation

### 1. Authentication

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx agentlogs login
```

### 2. Configure OpenCode

Add the plugin to your `opencode.json` config file:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@agentlogs/opencode"]
}
```

## How It Works

The plugin captures transcripts using OpenCode events:

- **session.created** - Initializes tracking for a new session
- **session.idle** - Uploads the complete transcript when the session becomes idle
- **tool.execute.before** - Intercepts git commits to add transcript links

Transcripts are automatically deduplicated server-side based on session ID.
