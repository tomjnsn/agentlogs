<Warning>Codex support is **experimental**. The integration works but may have rough edges.</Warning>

# Codex Integration

Codex is OpenAI's CLI for coding with GPT models. AgentLogs provides automatic transcript capture through an MCP server integration.

## Features

- **Automatic capture** - Transcripts are uploaded after each agent response
- **Background service** - Watches sessions and handles uploads automatically

## Installation

### 1. Authentication

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx agentlogs login
```

### 2. Configure MCP Server

Run the following command to add the AgentLogs MCP server:

```bash
codex mcp add agentlogs -- npx -y agentlogs mcp
```

<Accordion title="Manual configuration">
Alternatively, add the following to your Codex config file (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.agentlogs]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "agentlogs", "mcp"]
```

</Accordion>

## How It Works

The MCP server is spawned by Codex and connects to a background service that watches `~/.codex/sessions` for changes. When an agent response completes, the transcript is uploaded.

The MCP server doesn't expose any tools or prompts—it exists purely for lifecycle management. The background service shuts down automatically after all Codex sessions close.
