# Usage

The AgentLogs CLI is the primary way to sync transcripts from AI coding assistants to your AgentLogs account. No installation required — just run it with `npx`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.0+
- macOS, Linux, or Windows

## Authentication

Before syncing, you need to log in to your AgentLogs account:

```bash
npx agentlogs login <hostname>
```

For production:

```bash
npx agentlogs login agentlogs.ai
```

This initiates a device authorization flow:

1. The CLI displays a user code
2. A browser window opens to the verification URL
3. Enter the code and authorize the device
4. The CLI receives an access token and stores it locally

## Check Status

Verify you're logged in:

```bash
npx agentlogs status
```

This shows, per configured host:

- Authentication status
- Logged-in user details
- Last login time

## Logout

To log out and remove stored credentials:

```bash
npx agentlogs logout [hostname]
```

- With hostname: logs out from that host only
- Without hostname: logs out from all hosts
