The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me analyze the conversation chronologically:\n\n1. **Message 1**: User ran `/clear` command (local command, should be ignored per instructions)\n2. **Message 2**: User asked \"how are you doing\"\n3. **Message 3**: I responded politely that I'm doing well and asked what they'd like to work on\n4. **Message 4**: User is now requesting a detailed summary of the conversation\n\nThis is a very brief conversation with minimal technical content. The user has:\n- Cleared the conversation history\n- Made a casual greeting\n- Requested a summary\n\nThere have been NO:\n- Technical requests\n- File operations\n- Code changes\n- Errors\n- Problem solving\n- Pending tasks\n- Current work in progress\n\nThe conversation literally just started after a clear command, so there is essentially nothing to summarize in terms of development work, technical decisions, or code patterns.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user cleared the conversation history, made a casual greeting (\"how are you doing\"), and then requested a detailed summary of the conversation. There have been no explicit technical requests or development intents expressed in this conversation.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   None discussed in this conversation.\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   No files have been read, modified, or created in this conversation.\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   No errors encountered in this conversation.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   No problems have been addressed or troubleshooting efforts undertaken in this conversation.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"how are you doing\"\n   - [Current request for conversation summary]\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   No pending tasks have been identified or requested.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   No development work was being performed before this summary request. The conversation just began after a `/clear` command, with only a casual greeting exchange before the summary was requested.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   None. There is no ongoing work to continue.
